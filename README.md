# Project Proposal
The Wellbeing App is a workplace-driven project aimed at boosting employee mental health and mindfulness through a platform built personally for our organization. Unlike external providers, this in-house app gives us full control over features and design, making it easier to adapt based on team feedback and evolving needs. By aligning the app with our culture, we aim to promote better wellbeing for our employees. Key features include motivational quotes, a mood tracker and a gratitude journal.

# Benefits
Customisability: Fully adaptable to reflect our team's unique wellbeing priorities.
Cost Efficiency: Avoids ongoing costs from third-party providers while developing internal expertise.
Employee Engagement: Encourages daily reflection and connection with mindfulness practices.
Sustainable Growth: Establishes a foundation for future wellness initiatives and in-house innovation - currently simple, yet potential is limitless!

# UI Prototype
I created a Figma prototype for a clear visualisation of the Wellbeing App. It includes a welcoming banner, a simple and accessible calendar for selecting dates, a motivational quote section, an interactive mood tracker with smiley faces, and a gratitude journal for daily reflections. The gradient background adds a calming and inviting aesthetic, while the straightforward layout ensures ease of use. Creating a prototype allows me (developer(s)) to refine the app's design and user experience early, reducing risks and time-wasting during development. It ensures clear communication and collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders, so that everyone is aligned on the projectâ€™s vision. Prototyping also provides an opportunity to gather feedback and make improvements before committing to coding, again saving time and resources.
